### 2. Creating a New Virtual Machine:
At this stage, I chose the name of the virtual machine, its location, and the ISO image I used.

### 3. Configuring the Virtual Machine:
Here, I selected the amount of RAM and the number of processor cores.

For this virtual machine, 20GB of disk space was enough. I also checked the option to make the virtual disk **static** (this was a mistake).

Additionally, I set up a **bridge** network adapter.

### 4. Installing the Operating System:
The ISO image was added as an optical disk.

#### Install Ubuntu on Your Virtual Machine
During installation, I answered some basic questions like selecting a language, choosing a username, setting a password, and more.

### 5. Saving and Restoring the VM State:
#### Create a Snapshot of Your VM After Setup
Right after installation, I created a system snapshot to save its working state.

#### Run Basic Commands (For Example, Creating a File, `rm -rf /`)
I ran the command `rm -rf /`, which **completely destroyed my system**. After running it, the system wouldnâ€™t start. The only thing that helped me recover was the snapshot.

#### Restore the VM to the Previous Snapshot
The snapshot worked, and the system was restored to the exact state it was in before the experiment.

### 6. Changing VM Settings via the GUI:
#### Increasing the Disk Size:
At this stage, I encountered an issue: when creating a **fixed-size** disk, **its size cannot be changed later**. This applies to both `.vdi` and `.vhd` formats. 

On the VirtualBox forum, the recommended solution was to create a **copy** and change the disk type to **dynamic**.

I did this using the `clonemedium` and `modifymedium` commands.

#### After Increasing the Disk Size, Expand the Filesystem in Ubuntu:
Using the commands suggested by ChatGPT, I successfully expanded the filesystem. ðŸ˜†

#### Final Result:

#### Changing CPU Cores and RAM:

#### Shutting Down and Deleting the VM:
To shut down the machine, I used the command:

```sh
shutdown -P now
```

To delete it, I used the **GUI** option **"Remove with all files"**.

### Shared Folder on Ubuntu Server:
To create a shared folder, first go to the **Devices** menu and select **"Insert Guest Additions CD image"**.

![Folder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad36dbc1-87d4-42f4-956c-38d7ffcbf197)

This creates a **virtual CD-ROM**, which needs to be mounted to a folder.

![MountCdrom](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e067020a-eaa9-40cd-b3fb-457dde035d7c)

Inside, there is a file called `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`. Before running it, install the necessary dependencies using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Then, execute the script:

```sh
./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

This installs the required additions.

Next, create a folder for shared files and shut down the virtual machine.

```sh
mkdir ubuntu_files
```

Then, go to the **VM settings** and configure the shared folder.

![FolderInVM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46008907-0cec-4f68-8cb9-745e8d517eb4)

For the **"Path to the folder"**, select a location on your local machine.  
For **"Mount point"**, enter the path to the folder you just created on the VM.

Thatâ€™s it! Now, files from your local machine are accessible inside the virtual machine. ðŸŽ‰
